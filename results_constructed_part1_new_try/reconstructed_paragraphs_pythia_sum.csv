Low Pythia and High KenLM,80,scientists.,25.351396444350662,0.880859375,Leading water scientists have issued one of the sternest warnings yet about global food supplies, saying that the world's population may have to switch almost completely to a vegetarian diet by 2050 to avoid catastrophic shortages. Humans derive about 20% of their protein from animal-based products now, but this may need to drop to just 5% to feed the extra two billion people expected to be alive by 2050, according to research by some of the world's leading water scientists. “There will not be enough water available on current croplands to produce food for the expected nine-billion population in 2050 if we follow current trends and changes towards diets common in western nations,” the report by Malik Falkenmark and colleagues at the Stockholm International Water Institute (SIWI) said.
Low Pythia and High KenLM,131,America,,26.82319063629325,1.294677734375,“There will be just enough water if the proportion of animal-based foods is limited to 5% of total calories and considerable regional water deficits can be met by a reliable system of food trade.” Dire warnings of water scarcity limiting food production come as Oxfam and the UN prepare for a possible second global food crisis in five years. Prices for staples such as corn and wheat have risen nearly 50% on international markets since June, triggered by severe droughts in the US and Russia, and weak monsoon rains in Asia. More than 18 million people are already facing serious food shortages across the Sahel. Oxfam has forecast that the price spike will have a devastating impact in developing countries that rely heavily on food imports, including parts of Latin America, North Africa and the Middle East. Food shortages in 2008 led to civil unrest in 28 countries.

Very High Pythia and High KenLM,56,ununtrium,,25.89832643922119,42.518798828125,The US-based International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC), the global organization that governs chemical nomenclature, terminology and measurement, verified the elements on 30 December, 2015 after poring over studies dating back to 2004. The scientists who found them must now come up with formal names to replace the clunky Latin- based placeholders – ununtrium, ununpentium, ununseptium and ununoctium – which reflect their atomic numbers, 113, 115, 117, and 118. The atomic number is the number of protons found in an element's atomic nucleus.
Very High Pythia and High KenLM,2,Zaglumyonova,24.216568977613164,41.546630859375,Galina Zaglumyonova was woken in her flat in central Chelyabinsk by a very big explosion that broke the balcony windows and broken pots containing her houseplants. When she jumped out of bed she could see a huge vapor trail in the morning sky and hear car alarms from the street below. “I didn't understand what was going on,” said Zaglumyonova. “There was a big explosion and then lots of little explosions. My first thought was that it was a plane crash.” In fact, it was a ten-ton meteorite that fell to Earth in lots of pieces. Almost 1,200 people were injured. More than 40 people were taken to hospital – most of them were hurt by flying glass. There were no deaths.
Very High Pythia and High KenLM,26,“Ouallywood”,23.521791424438568,40.179443359375,The Moroccan city of Ouarzazate is used to big productions. It is on the edge of the Sahara Desert and at the center of Morocco's “Ouallywood” film industry. Now, the trading city is the location for a complex of four linked solar mega-plants, which, alongside hydro and wind, will help provide nearly half of Morocco's electricity from renewables by 2020 with, it is hoped, some spare to export to Europe. The project is a key plank in Morocco's ambitions to use its deserts to become a global solar superpower. When the full complex is complete, it will be the largest concentrated solar power plant in the world and the first phase, called Noor 1, will go live in November 2015. The mirror technology it uses is less widespread and more expensive than the photovoltaic panels that are now familiar on roofs the world over but it will have the advantage of being able to continue producing power even after the sun goes down.
High Pythia and Low KenLM,16,livermorium,3.133265125387076,28.09033203125,When elements 114 and 116 were assigned formal names in 2012, scientists chose flerovium and livermorium respectively, after the Flerov Lab at Dubna's Joint Institute of Research and the Lawrence Livermore Lab in the US, where the elements were discovered. Kosuke Morita, who led the research at RIKEN, said his team now planned to “look into the uncharted territory of element 119 and beyond.” Jan Reedijk, president of the Inorganic Chemistry Division of IUPAC, said: “The chemistry community is eager to see its most cherished table finally being completed down to the seventh row.”
High Pythia and Low KenLM,3,Censorship,0.3880513299738937,16.9404296875,Index on Censorship agrees. The magazine's editor, Rachael Jolley, said: “Illegal downloading is a very big problem.” Between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files. 18% of Internet users aged over 12 say they have pirated items, and 9% say they are afraid they will get caught. Pullman writes in his article: “The ease and speed with which people can get music in MP3 is still very surprising to people like me who have been building up their iTunes list for some time.”
High Pythia and Low KenLM,3,Censorship,0.3880513299738937,16.940185546875,Index on Censorship agrees. The magazine's editor, Rachael Jolley, said: “Existing copyright laws don't work in the digital age and risk criminalizing consumers. We need new models for how artists, writers and musicians earn a living from their work.” The scale of illegal downloading vast. Data collected by Ofcom (the competition authority for the UK communications industries) suggests that, between November 2012 and January 2013 in the UK, 280 million music tracks were digitally pirated, along with 52 million TV shows, 29 million films, 18 million ebooks and 7 million software or games files. Ofcom has said 18% of Internet users aged over 12 admit to having recently pirated content, and 9% say they fear getting caught. Pullman writes in his article: “The ease and swiftness with which music can be acquired in the form of MP3 downloads is still astonishing to those of us who have been building up our iTunes list for some time.”
